## This website is designed to demonstrate proof of competency rather then traditional experience in machine learning engineering.
### A mechanical engineering degree instills an analytical, resourceful, and innovative mindset focused on solving complex physical problems through logic and creativity. We devolop a "systems-thinking" approach, balancing technical precision with safety, ethical, and economic considerations to design, test, and improve machines and systems.
