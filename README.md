### This website is designed to demonstrate proof of competency rather then traditional experience in machine learning engineering. 
#### The curriculum of a mechanical engineering degree is designed to cultivate and embed an analytical, resourceful, and innovative mindset focused on solving complex physical problems through logic and creativity. Engineers devolop a "systems-thinking" approach, balancing technical precision with safety, ethical, and economic considerations to design, test, and improve machines and systems. 
#### Web searches to discover which skills and tools are required of a machine learning engineer, returned results included but not limited from; MIT, Harvard, Standford, Univeristy of Chicago..., strongly suggest similar curriculum design intent as professionals with both academic and practical experience.

|Quality/Production Engineering|MLOps/AI-driven Process Optimization|(Ensuring the model/system behaves correctly in production)|
|Structuring Data|Data Processing/Data Profiling|(Cleaning, normalizing, and structuring raw data for analysis)|
|Root Cause Analysis|Causal ML/Anomaly Detection|(Identifying true causes vs. symptoms in datasets)|
|Communicating Complex Findings|Model Interpretability/Explanable AI(XAI)/Stakeholder Reporting||
|Data Analyst|Data Scientist/Machine learning Engineer||

#### My autodidactic and eclectic character traits, combined with the dicipline and focus assimulated through school, and skill stacking professional expericences, make it highly probable and statistically viable for me to effectively function with the same technical skills as expected from a Machine Learning Engineer.
