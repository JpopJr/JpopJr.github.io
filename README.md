### This website is designed to demonstrate proof of competency rather then traditional experience in machine learning engineering. 
#### The curriculum of a mechanical engineering degree is designed to cultivate and embed an analytical, resourceful, and innovative mindset focused on solving complex physical problems through logic and creativity. Engineers devolop a "systems-thinking" approach, balancing technical precision with safety, ethical, and economic considerations to design, test, and improve machines and systems. 
#### The results from researching machine learning skills and tools, from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, well known universities; MIT, Harvard, Standford, Univeristy of Chicago..., strongly suggest similar design intent.

|Quality/Production Engineering|MLOps/AI-driven Process Optimization|(Ensuring the model/system behaves correctly in production)|
|Structuring Data|Data Processing/Data Profiling|(Cleaning, normalizing, and structuring raw data for analysis)|
|Root Cause Analysis|Causal ML/Anomaly Detection|(Identifying true causes vs. symptoms in datasets)|
|Communicating Complex Findings|Model Interpretability/Explanable AI(XAI)/Stakeholder Reporting||
|Data Analyst|Data Scientist/Machine learning Engineer||

#### My autodidactic and eclectic character traits, with the dicipline and focus assimulated through completing a mechnical engineering degree the fundamental skills developed Quality/Production Engineering and Technical Writing into core technical skills for Machine Learning Engineering.
