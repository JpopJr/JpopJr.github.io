<h1>Jose I. Popoca Jr. Cover Letter</h1>

<p>
I have a proven track record in quality management, production engineering, and technical writing of complex critical systems. I interpret metrics, incorporate strategies, and publish results for audiances of diverse groups.
</p>

<p>
As a quality management analyst, I verify adherence to documentation style guides and standards. Cross-references, including table of context, external sources, supportive charts, procedures and processes are audited for consistency, fact, and comprehension. Verification of these elements communicates respect, concern, value, and trust. These are work ethics that customers, employees, and executives notice, and look forward to them. Incidently, I have interests in modern digital tools. I will assimulate virtually any technology you ask of me in an efficient and timely manner.
</p>

<p>
I have practical experience in the following areas as well: Lean Six Sigma, documentation version control, integration of regulated compliance, and with cross-functional collaboration. This translates into accurate accessment of business objectives. I welcome you to reference my resume, if you get the oportunity.
</p>

<p>
I am motivated, focused, exercise empathy and respect, and I value the people I work with.
</p>

<p>
Explanation of the financial gap in my employment history. A combination of events transpired during the calendar year of 2008. Subprime mortgage crisis, Financial institution collapse, MPC purchased by Woodward, and Woodward release of everyone on medical family leave. <br>
I decided to dedicate my life to care for my parents. I successfully completed formal courses in healthcare to better serve them, and strengthened my financial acumen to manage their estate. <br>
My father passed in 7/16/2016, and my mother passed in 1/23/2026.

</p>
I respectfully propose a trial/internship to prove my capabilities, as well as for learning and guidance.
