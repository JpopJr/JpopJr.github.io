The architecture of my website, JpopJr.github.io is set to define my objectives and scope, conduct a skill gap analysis, map a curriculum structure, create a temporal map, and incorporate active learning & assessment.
</p>

</p>
<p>
I have a proven track record in quality management, production engineering, and technical writing on flight critical components for both military and commercial airlines. I am currently digitizing these skills with AI & Data-Driven Technology.
</p>

<p>
As a quality documentation analyst, I author and standardize, compliant procedures, publish an accessible library – Standard Operating Procedures, Work Instructions, and Maintenance Manuals – resulting in 20% reduction in training. 
</p>

<p>
My resume outlines practical experience with; Lean Six Sigma, documentation version control, integration of regulated compliance (FAA and ISO), and cross-functional collaboration. I welcome you to reference it, if you get the oportunity.
</p>

<p>
I am motivated, focused, a good listener, exercise empathy, respect, and I value the people I work with.

The financial gap in my employment history explained. A combination of things happened during the calendar year of 2008. Subprime mortgage crisis, Financial institution collapse, MPC purchased by Woodward, and Woodward release of everyone on medical family leave. <br>
I decided to dedicate my life to care for my parents. I successfully completed formal courses in healthcare, and managed their estate. <br>
My father passed in 2016, and my mother passed in 1/23/2026.

</p>
I respectfully propose a trial/internship to prove my capabilities, as well as for learning and guidance.
