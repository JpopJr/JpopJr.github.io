This website is designed to demonstrate proof of competency rather then traditional experience in machine learning engineering.<br>
The curriculum of a mechanical engineering program is designed to cultivate and embed an analytical, resourceful, and innovative <br>
mindset, focused on solving complex physical problems through logic and creativity. Engineers devolop a systems-thinking approach, <br>
balancing technical precision with safety, ethical, and economic considerations to design, test, and improve machines and systems.<br>
</p>
<p>
Web searches to discover which skills and tools are required of a machine learning engineer returned results included but not <br>
limited from; MIT, Harvard, Standford, Univeristy of Chicago... The programs offered by these institutions strongly suggest similar<br>
curriculum design and intent; the synergy between academic intellect and its practical application.<br>
