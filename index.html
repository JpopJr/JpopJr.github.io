This website is designed to demonstrate proof of competency rather then traditional experience in machine learning engineering.<br>
The curriculum of a mechanical engineering degree is designed to cultivate and embed an analytical, resourceful, and innovative <br>
mindset focused on solving complex physical problems through logic and creativity. Engineers devolop a systems-thinking approach, <br>
balancing technical precision with safety, ethical, and economic considerations to design, test, and improve machines and systems.<br>
</p>
<p>
Web searches to discover which skills and tools are required of a machine learning engineer, returned results included but not <br>
limited from; MIT, Harvard, Standford, Univeristy of Chicago..., strongly suggest similar curriculum design intent as professionals<br>
with both academic and practical experience.<br>\
